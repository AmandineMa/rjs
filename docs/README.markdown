# RosJasonSoftware (RJS)

This software is a bridge between ROS, using [rosjava](http://wiki.ros.org/rosjava), and [Jason](https://github.com/jason-lang/jason.git). 

There is an existing software, [jason_ros](https://github.com/jason-lang/jason_ros.git), aiming at the same goal but it was barely existing when we started to need such a bridge. Thus, we developed RJS. 


## RJS features
- Interfaces to implement ROS topics, services and action clients which can be called by a Jason Agent through Jason Actions
- High possibilities of customization of how the Jason Actions are handled


## Usage

[View the documentation](https://amdia.github.io/rjs/) for usage information.
